Awesome.

00:02.780 --> 00:03.950
Let's get started.

00:03.950 --> 00:04.700
I'm Daniel.

00:04.730 --> 00:08.980
In this chapter we are going to warm up with a full taste of advanced scholar.

00:09.170 --> 00:15.350
We're going to do three big things first of all we'll get a refresher of what we know so far and then

00:15.350 --> 00:20.600
we'll dive into you some dark syntactic sugars that will make Skylar an even more expressive language

00:20.600 --> 00:22.720
than we were even aware.

00:22.760 --> 00:27.250
And after that we will learn how to customize pattern matching with our own patterns.

00:27.260 --> 00:28.150
I hope you're excited.

00:28.160 --> 00:29.810
So let's move to the next video.
