00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:02,780
Awesome.


2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,950
Let's get started.


3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:04,700
I'm Daniel.


4
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,980
In this chapter we are going to warm up with a full taste of advanced scholar.


5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:15,350
We're going to do three big things first of all we'll get a refresher of what we know so far and then


6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:20,600
we'll dive into you some dark syntactic sugars that will make Skylar an even more expressive language


7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,720
than we were even aware.


8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,250
And after that we will learn how to customize pattern matching with our own patterns.


9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,150
I hope you're excited.


10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,810
So let's move to the next video.
